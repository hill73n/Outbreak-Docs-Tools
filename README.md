# Outbreak-Docs-Tools
This is simply an attempt to bring together in one place all Biohazard Outbreak File 1 and File 2 documentation and info regarding the files and contents/function of each to the extent it is known.
In addition any useful tools that are freely available and where permission has been granted by the authors will be collected here too.
Feel free to contribute if you have any info not included here or any relevant tools/apps you would like to share.
Hope this is useful to some people who are interested in modding aspects of the Outbreak games or just those curious how it works.
Thanks for stopping by...
